### Introduction

This is a work in progress simple interpreter for a subset of Pascal. This
interpreter is based on the [Let's build a simple interpreter](https://ruslanspivak.com/lsbasi-part1/) 
series by Ruslan. You can follow this amazing blog if you want to learn more about it.

### Disclaimer

The code presented here is by no means the best way to handle certain topics. I
don't even know if the way I have handled certain things is proper, which I
think it's not. But that's fine, as the aim of this whole project was and is to
explore into the magic that happens on the text we write as a programmer which
I was taking for granted for such a long time.

#### To the reader

I hope this can be useful for someone learning interpreter design.
